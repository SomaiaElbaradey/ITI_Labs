            Sometimes the size of the array you declared may be insufficient. To solve this issue, you can allocate
            memory manually during run-time. This is known as dynamic memory allocation in C programming.
            Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution
            that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply
            store the results of subproblems.
