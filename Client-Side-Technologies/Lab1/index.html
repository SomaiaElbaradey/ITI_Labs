        <p>Most of the teaching I do is aimed at improving the student’s spoken English. Form I like I don’t like. Do I
            like you like you don’t like Do you like he/she/it likes she doesn’t like Does it like we like we don’t
            like Do we like they like they don’t like Do they like Video The Present Simple in use – example sentences
            We use the present simple I tend to duck out of teaching written English because you have to do a lot of

            Not so much for letter or report writing…</p>
